            When it first starts to turn chilly outside, I like to put on a pot of mulled cider. There are lots of from-scratch recipes out there, but it can also be as easy as cider plus a store-bought pouch of mulling spices (amp it up by adding a couple extra cinnamon sticks and thin slices of orange). Let the pot simmer on the stove, or use a slow cooker; either way, your house is going to smell great, and you'll be warmed from the inside out.<br><br>
            For an adult beverage, add a splash of Calvados, a French apple brandy. Trader Joe's carries a nice one this time of year.
