  Years ago, I was fortune enough to stumble upon a link to Leslie Harpold's online advent calendar. It was full of lovely writing, featuring everything from happy holiday memories by Leslie and her readers, to Scottish shortbread recipes, to proper mistletoe etiquette (you have to remove a berry once you've kissed under it; if the mistletoe has no more berries, then there can be no more kissing). I have vivid memories of sitting in my school's computer lab, checking the day's post and enjoying a moment's respite from the stress of finals.<br><br>
  Very sadly, Leslie passed away in 2006. However, a sampling of her advent calendars can still be found <a href="http://meghanagain.tumblr.com/post/13592455559/leslies-advent-calendars" alt="here">here</a>, reconstructed via the Wayback Machine.
