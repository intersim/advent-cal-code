            One of my favorite festive indulgences is hot chocolate, and while I'm happy with a microwaved cup of Nestl√©, there are a variety of ways that you can step up your cocoa game this festive season:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>If you prefer the convenience of store-bought hot chocolate mixes, Serious Eats has a taste test of both <a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2010/12/the-best-hot-chocolate-cocoa-mixes-drinks-taste-test-winter-jacques-torres-mariebelle.html" alt="hot chocolate mixes">hot chocolate mixes</a> and <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/the-best-fancy-hot-chocolate-drinking-chocolate.html" alt="fancy drinking chocolate">fancy drinking chocolate</a> to help you make your decision in the grocery store.</li>
                <li>If you want to go one step further, The Food Lab has a delicious <a href="http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2010/12/the-food-lab-homemade-hot-chocolate-mix.html" alt="hot chocolate mix recipe">hot chocolate mix recipe</a> that you can blend up yourself. Stick it in a mason jar and tie a ribbon around it and you've got a lovely homemade gift.</li>
                <li>For the ultimate homemade hot chocolate, try this <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2009/01/belgian-hot-chocolate/" alt="Belgian hot chocolate recipe">Belgian hot chocolate recipe</a> from noted chocoholic David Lebovitz. A warning, though: I've made this recipe before with half and half, and it was so rich it was like drinking cheese. You may want to following Lebovitz's suggestion and use whole or even low fat milk instead.</li>
                <li>And lastly, for those of you interested in a more "adult" beverage, here is Serious Eats' slideshow of <a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/02/7-ways-to-spike-your-hot-cocoa-boozy-hot-chocolate.html" alt="">7 ways to spike your hot cocoa</a>. Personally, I love mine with a splash of peppermint schnapps.</li>
