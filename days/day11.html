            <li>Knit yourself a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/crazyknittinglady/nightcap" alt="Scrooge/Krachit nightcap">Scrooge/Krachit nightcap</a>.</li>
            <li>Once you've got your nightcap knitted, it's time to get into the story! If you've got a group of people at home, I recommend making it a multi-night event; turn the lights out, light a candle, and take turns reading aloud.</li>
            <li>If you'd rather watch or listen than read: Patrick Stewart's one man show version is legendary. While I haven't been able to find a video of it, an audio recording is still available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Reissue-Charles-Dickens/dp/0743563794/ref=pd_sim_15_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KG2PZGKSW4ZE24CBCXE&dpID=31Sc%2BKn5DnL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR140%2C160" alt="Amazon">Amazon</a>. The 1999 TV movie featuring Stewart is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>If you're less of a traditionalist, you could also go for A Muppet Christmas Carol, in which case you may enjoy this <a href="http://www.hexjam.com/uk/food-drink/top-5-drinking-games-for-the-festive-season" alt="accompanying drinking game">accompanying drinking game</a>.</li>
