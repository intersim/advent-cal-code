<div class="content">
            For any family, there are always certain dishes that are essential for the holiday table. In our house that includes <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/dutch+egg+nog+pennsylvania+usa" alt="Pennsylvania Dutch egg nog">Pennsylvania Dutch egg nog</a> (often diluted with non-alcoholic egg nog), my mother's special extra-fatty stuffing recipe, and bacon-wrapped dates. The genius of the bacon-wrapped dates is that they can be prepared the night before and popped into the oven as soon as you start cooking the next day. Between them and the egg nog, you can keep everyone happy even if Christmas dinner is delayed.

            <b>Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Dates</b><br><br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            Dried dates (if you want to get extra fancy, go for Medjool dates; you can get pitted dates to save yourself some prep work)<br>
            Parmigianno-reggiano<br>
            Bacon<br><br>
            Directions:<br>
            Remove the pits from the dates and cut the parmigianno-reggiano into large chunks. Stuff the dates with the cheese, then wrap them with bacon. Place prepared dates seam side-down on a baking tray. At this point you may place the tray into the freezer, uncovered, to be baked the next day. Bake the dates in a 400F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the bacon is crispy; if you bake them straight from the freezer, it might be more like 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.
