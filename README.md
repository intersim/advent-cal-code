# advent-cal-code

You can see a working version of the calendar here: http://www.emilyjazz.com/advent.html

This project is intended to be a simple, festive page I can share with family and friends. It's also given me an opportunity to learn new things about design and coding. It was inspired by Leslie Harpold's online advent calendars, which I used to follow almost 10 years ago. The main page is a calendar for the month of December, with each number linking to a page for that day. Each day will have some sort of festive content (with a particular interest in food, music, and Christmas and Winter traditions from around the world). 

I wanted the page to have a vintage look; the look was inspired by a 1950s Christmas card I found, as well as vintage illustrated versions of The Night Before Christmas.

Upcoming changes: I'll be continuing to improve the content for each of the "day" pages. I particularly want to add more images and fun visuals to make the day pages more entertaining.
