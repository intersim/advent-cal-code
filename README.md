# advent-cal-code

You can see a working version of the calendar here: http://www.emilyjazz.com/advent.html

This project is intended to be a simple, festive page I can share with family and friends. It's also given me an opportunity to learn new things about design and coding. It was inspired by Leslie Harpold's online advent calendars, which I used to follow almost 10 years ago.

The main page is a calendar for the month of December, with each number linking to a page for that day. Each day will have some sort of festive content.

Upcoming changes: I'll be continuing to change or update content for each of the "day" pages. I particularly want to add more images and fun visuals to make the day pages more entertaining.
